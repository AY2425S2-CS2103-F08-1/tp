### Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** below illustrates the high-level structure of the application.

![img.png](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

**Overview of Main Components of the architecture**

**`Main`** contains two key classes:
[Main]() and
[MainApp](), which are responsible for,
* Application Startup: Ensuring all components are initialized in the correct order and properly linked.
* At shut down: Managing the termination of components and executing necessary cleanup operations.

[**`Commons`**]() serves as a collections of shared classes that are utilized by multiple components
within the application.

The Application is further structured into four core components:

* [**`UI`**](): The UI of the Application.
* [**`Logic`**](): Processes User commands.
* [**`Model`**](): Manages in-memory application data.
* [**`Storage`**](): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**Interaction between Architecture Components**

The *Sequence Diagram* below illustrates how the main components interact when processing a typical command,
such as `delete 1 cfm`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Sequence Diagram" width="656" />

Each of the four components (illustrated in the diagram above) follows a structured design pattern:

* Each component defines its `interface`, ensuring a well-defined *API* for interaction.
* The implementation of each component follows this interface using a corresponding **manager class**.
* For instance, the `Logic` component defines its interface in `logic.java` and implements its functionality in
`logicManage.java`.
* Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than its concrete
implementation. This approach minimizes coupling, making the system more modular and maintainable, as illustrated
in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" alt = "Component Manager" width="324" />

**Detailed overview of Components**

The following sections provide an in-depth explanation of each major component in the
system, including their responsibilities and how they interact with other parts of the application

### UI Component

The **UI Component** is responsible for handling user interactions. Its API is defined in
[`UI.java`]()

<img src="images/UIClassDiagram.png" alt = "UI Class Diagram" width="1156" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is composed of multiple subcomponents, including:
* `CommandBox`
* `ResultDisplay`
* `ReservationListPanel`
* `StatusBarFooter`
* `HelpWindow`

All these components, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures the
commonalities between different UI elements.

**Framework and layout**

The UI is built using the **JavaFx UI framework**. The layout of UI elements defined in .fxml is located in the
`src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout for `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWinow.fxml`.

**Reponsibilities**

The UI Component performs the following key functions:
* Executing User Commands: It forwards user input to the `Logic` component for processing.
* Listening for Data Changes: It observes updates in the `Model` component to refresh the displayed data dynamically.
* Maintaining a Reference to Logic: The UI keeps a direct reference to `Logic` component since it relies on
it to execute commands.
* Displaying Model Data: It depends on some classes from the `Model` component to render `Reservation` objects
stored in memory.


### Logic Component

The **Logic Component** is responsible for interpreting user input, executing commands, and managing interactions
between `UI`, `Model`, and `Storage` components. Its API is defined in
[`Logic.java`]().

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" alt = "Logic Class Diagram" width="500"/>


**Command Execution Flow**
1. The UI component calls the `Logic` interface when a user enters a command.
2. `LogicManager` delegates the command parsing to an `ReserveaMateParser` object which in turn creates a parser that
matches the command (e.g, `DeleteCommandPaser`) and uses it to parse the command.
3. Once parsed, `LogicManger` exeutes the `Command` object, which may interact with the `Model` component to
update reservation data.
4. The `Command` object returns a `CommandResult`, encapsulating feedback on the execution outcome.
5. `LogicManager` forwards the `CommandResult` to the UI component, which updates the display accordingly.

The sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `logic` component for the `execute("delete 1 cfm")
API call.

![img.png](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

![img.png](images/ParserClasses.png)

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ReserveMateParser` class creates an `XYZCommandPaser` (`XYZ` is a
placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown aboev to parse
the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ReservateMateParser` returns back as
a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteComandParser`,...) inherits from the `Parser`
interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model Component

Its API is defined in: [`Model.java`]()

![img.png](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,
* Stores the reserve mate data i.e, all `Reservation` objects (which are contained in a
`UniqueReservationList` object).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Reservation` object (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate *filtered* list
which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Reservation>` that can be 'observed' e.g the UI can be
bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
`ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

ðŸ’¡**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP)
model is given below. It has a `Occasion` list in the `ReserveMate`, which `Reservation` references. This allows
`ReserveMate` to only require one `Occasion` object per unique occasion, instead of each `Reservation` needing their
own `Occasion` objects.<br>

![img.png](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)


### Storage component

Its API is defined in: [`Storage.java`]()

![img.png](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* Can save both reserve mate data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
objects.
* Inherits from both `ReserveMateStorage` and `userPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if
only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
that belong to the `model`)


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.reserve.commons` package.

## Appendix: Requirements

**Team**: F08-1

**Name**: ReserveMate

**Target User Profile**: Our application is designed for small restaurant owners who have to manage numerous customer reservations and contact details. These users often operate in fast-paced environments and need a simple yet effective system to organize all reservations.


**Value Proposition**: ReserveMate provides small restaurant owners with a fast and intuitive way to manage reservation and customer contact details through a Command Line Interface (CLI). This enhances operational efficiency by streamlining organisation and ensuring easy access to customer contact details.
